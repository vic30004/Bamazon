# Setup 

In order to create this app I hade to use: 

    * node.js
    * mysql
    * javascrupt

I used the inquirer and faker npm packages from node. The inquirer helped me set up the follow up questions, where as faker helped me set up my database. Faker is very interesting library and helps create a database by providing random product or customer data. 

# Challanges

The more I play around with Javascript the easier these challanges get. However, that doesn't mean I didn't encounter difficulties. The main problem I was stuck on was to make sure all the functions are linked to each other properly. If there was an error with one they all broke. So, I had to make sure each function was running properly before I moving on.
